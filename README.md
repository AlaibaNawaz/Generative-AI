A1: A comprehensive assignment on implementing GANs and VAEs with MNIST datasets, comparing their performance, and applying VAEs to real-world anomaly detection problems.

A2: An assignment focusing on implementing and evaluating computer vision models including Vision Transformers (ViT), CLIP, and Stable Diffusion for spoof detection, image retrieval, and image generation tasks using COCO and CelebA-Spoof datasets.

A3: An assignment requiring implementation and comparison of four fine-tuning techniques (Full Fine-Tuning, LoRA, QLoRA, and IA3 Adapters) for RoBERTa-Base on IMDB sentiment classification, evaluating accuracy, parameter count, training time, and GPU memory usage.
